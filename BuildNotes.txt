Paragon Build Notes
=================================================

LINUX:
-------------------------------------------------

Building debian package: 
	Unsolved problem: depedency libassimp3 is not available in default repositories
	Possible solution: statically link to libassimp3 when building debian package

Building static binary:
	configure and build pioneer-thirdparty with these changes:
		to build libassimp as static, in source/assimp/CMakeLists.txt change "SET ( BUILD_STATIC_LIB OFF CACHE BOOL" to "ON"
	configure paragon:
		./configure --with-thirdparty=/path/to/pioneer-thirdparty
	alternatively, build assimp separately from /build with:
		cmake -DBUILD_STATIC_LIB=ON ..
	build paragon normally
	remove binary symbols to reduce size using strip:
		strip --strip-all src/paragon

Future suggestions:
	MojoSetup for distribution (http://icculus.org/mojosetup)
